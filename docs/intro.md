# Introduction to ts-pkgx

> A TypeScript library for fetching and working with pkgx.dev package information

ts-pkgx is a specialized library that provides tools for fetching, storing, and accessing package data from [pkgx.dev](https://pkgx.dev). It offers both programmatic APIs and CLI tools for developers who want to work with pkgx packages in their TypeScript applications.

## What is pkgx?

[pkgx.dev](https://pkgx.dev) is a package manager that simplifies the installation of development tools and dependencies. It provides a central repository of packages that can be easily installed and managed.

## Core Features

- **Package Fetching**: Retrieve detailed package information from pkgx.dev
- **TypeScript Integration**: Fully typed interfaces for all package data (see [TypeScript Types](./typescript-types.md))
- **Multiple Package Fetching**: Fetch multiple specific packages at once with the `--pkg` option
- **Optimized Batch Processing**: Efficiently process hundreds of packages with configurable concurrency
- **CLI Tools**: Comprehensive command line utilities for fetching and managing packages
- **Alias Support**: Handle package aliases (e.g., "node" for "nodejs.org")
- **Nested Paths**: Support for packages with nested paths (e.g., "agwa.name/git-crypt")
- **Smart Caching**: Configurable caching system to improve performance and avoid hitting rate limits
- **TypeScript Code Generation**: Convert package data into TypeScript files for easy use
- **Index Generation**: Automatically create indexes for easy access to all packages
- **JSON Output**: Option to output as JSON instead of TypeScript
- **Compiled Binaries**: Use pre-compiled binaries for various platforms
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Robust error handling with automatic retries

## Why ts-pkgx?

ts-pkgx simplifies the process of working with pkgx.dev package data in TypeScript projects. Instead of manually scraping the pkgx.dev website or trying to parse package information yourself, ts-pkgx provides a clean, type-safe interface for accessing this data.

## Get Started

To start using ts-pkgx in your project, check out the [Installation](./install.md) guide.

```bash
# Install with bun
bun install ts-pkgx

# Quick example: fetch package info
bun run pkgx:fetch node
```

## Project Structure

The project follows a clean and maintainable structure:

- `src/`: Source code for the library
  - `packages/`: Package definitions and utilities
  - `tools/`: Utility scripts for package handling
  - `types.ts`: TypeScript interfaces
- `bin/`: CLI tools
- `test/`: Comprehensive test suite
