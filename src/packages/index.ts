/**
 * The Pantry interface provides access to all available pkgx packages.

 *
 * Packages can be accessed by their domain name (e.g., `pantry.bunsh`) or by their aliases
 * (e.g., `pantry.bun`) for convenience.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { pantry } from 'ts-pkgx'
 *
 * // Access Node.js package by domain
 * const node = pantry.nodejsorg
 * console.log(node.description) // "Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine"
 * console.log(node.programs)    // ["node", "npm", "npx"]
 * console.log(node.versions[0]) // Latest version
 *
 * // Access Bun package by domain or alias
 * const bun1 = pantry.bunsh  // by domain
 * const bun2 = pantry.bun    // by alias (same object)
 * console.log(bun1 === bun2) // true
 * ```
